# Challenge-1

## Description

Challenge-1 is a SEO stratergy webpage where I implemented the elements of HTML I learned this week. I was able to locate and place sementic elements; alt attributes; and logical HTML structure. I was also able to practice creating a repo in GitHub and practice commiting and pushing a working project.
